An Entity–relationship model (ER model) describes the 
   structure of a database with the help of a diagram,
   which is known as Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram).

 ER diagram has three main components:
1. Entity
2. Attribute
3. Relationship

Rectangle    –  It represents entity in the ER Model.
Ellipse      –  It represents attribute in the ER Model.
Diamond      –  It represents relationship between entity and attribute.
Line         –  It links attribute(s) to entity set(s) and entity 
                    set(s) to relationship set(s).
Doubles Ellipses – It represents multivalued attributes.
Dashed Ellipses –  It denotes derived attributes.
Double lines –      It indicates total participation of an entity in 
                             a relationship set.
Double Rectangle – It represents weak entity set.
Double Diamonds – It represents weak relationships.
Multiple ellipses connected to single ellipse using lines – It represents composite attribute
Ellipse with line inside it – It represents single values attributes





Advantages of RDBMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?It is easy to use.
?It is secured in nature.
?The data manipulation can be done.
?It limits redundancy and replication of the data.
?It offers better data integrity.
?It provides better physical data independence.
?It offers logical database independence i.e. data can be viewed in
   different ways by the different users.
?Multiple users can access the database which is not possible in DBMS.
Drawbacks or disadvantages of RDBMS

Following are the disadvantages of RDBMS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
?Software is expensive.
?Complex software refers to expensive hardware and hence increases 
   overall cost to avail the RDBMS service.
?It requires skilled human resources to implement.
?Complex Queries have to be written ( usage of subquery and join ).
?It is difficult to recover the lost data.
